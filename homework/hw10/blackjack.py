Complete the program below to simulate a single hand of blackjack. The code for
creating a deck of cards and dealing cards is written for you. You can see the
slides discussing the code here:

http://foureyes.github.io/csci-ua.0002-spring2015-008/classes/20/lists_strings_random.html#5.0

Of course, the obligatory wikipedia article:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack

Add the following features to the program:

* continually ask the player whether they want to draw another card (hit) or
  stop drawing cards (stand)
* after either hitting or standing, calculate the total and display the
  player's last action, their hand and their hand's total (use the function
  written underneath the comments to run this calculation):

  (Player draws another card)
  Player Hand: ['2', 'J']
  Player Total: 12
  
* if the total of the player's cards are over 21, or if the player's says
  stand, stop asking the player whether they want to hit or stand
* if the player's cards are over 21, print out "BUST!"
* once the player is done drawing (or if they go over 21), populate the
  computer's hand by automatically removing cards from the deck and adding them to the computer's
  to the computer's hand until the total for the computer's hand is > 17
* determine who won:
  * the player who is the closest to 21 without going over wins
  * a ties is possible

Here's an example of run of the program:
=====

Player Hand: ['2', 'J']
Player Total: 12

(h)it or (s)tand?
> h

(Player draws another card)
Player Hand: ['2', 'J', '7']
Player Total: 19

(h)it or (s)tand?
> s

(Player stands)
Player Hand: ['2', 'J', '7']
Player Total: 19

Computer Hand: ['K', '6', '8']
Computer Total: 24

Player won!
=====

Another example with the player going over 21:
=====
Player Hand: ['J', '7']
Player Total: 17

(h)it or (s)tand?
> h

(Player draws another card)
Player Hand: ['J', '7', 'Q']
Player Total: 27
BUST

Computer Hand: ['Q', 'A']
Computer Total: 21

Computer won!
